/*
Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find the product of the k maximal numbers.

Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

Input >> Output Examples
maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20)
Explanation:
Since the size (k) equal 2 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 5 * 4 = 20 .
maxProduct ({8, 10 , 9, 7}, 3) ==>  return (720)
Explanation:
Since the size (k) equal 3 , then the subsequence of size 3 whose gives product of maxima is  8 * 9 * 10 = 720 .
maxProduct ({10, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4, 10}, 5) ==> return (9600)
*/

const size = 3;
const numbers = [10, 8, 7, 9];

function maxProduct(numbers, size) {
  return numbers
    .sort((a, b) => b - a)
    .slice(0, size)
    .reduce((acc, n) => acc * n);
}

console.log(maxProduct(numbers, size));
